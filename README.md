# mcts
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) basic implementation.

The basic idea is to implement a tic tac toe player using MCTS and match it
up against my previously written reinforcement learning agent (Q-learning).
I'm only doing that because I know that the q-learner can learn to play
optimally, so I can use it as a baseline player to evaluate and validate
the MCTS player.

For now the idea is to have a very simple MCTS policy, later I'll extend it
to have more sophisticated exploration/exploitation policies, and look into
other features.
